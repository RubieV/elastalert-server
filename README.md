# Elastalert Server
**A server that runs [ElastAlert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert) and exposes REST API's for manipulating rules and alerts. It works great in combination with our [ElastAlert Kibana plugin](https://github.com/bitsensor/elastalert-kibana-plugin).**

## Requirements
- [ElastAlert v0.0.96](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert/tree/v0.0.96). We don't support other versions of ElastAlert, use them at your own risk.
- [NodeJS 4.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with NPM & NVM.

## Docker installation
First, build the container locally:
```bash
docker build . -t elastalert
```
Then, run it, optionally with your custom ElastAlert configuration file. We've included a sensible default, with localhost as ES host.

_Bash_
```Bash
docker run -d -p 3030:3030 -v `pwd`/config/elastalert.yaml:/opt/elastalert/config.yaml -v `pwd`/config/elastalert-server.json:/opt/elastalert-server/config/config.json -v (pwd)/rules:/opt/elastalert/rules -v (pwd)/server-data:/opt/elastalert/server_dat --net="host" elastalert:latest
```

_Fish_
```fish
 docker run -ti -p 3030:3030 -v (pwd)/config/elastalert.yaml:/opt/elastalert/config.yaml -v (pwd)/config/elastalert-server.json:/opt/elastalert-server/config/config.json -v (pwd)/rules:/opt/elastalert/rules -v (pwd)/server-data:/opt/elastalert/server_data --net="host" elastalert:latest
```

## Docker in Mac
Edit `config/elastalert.yaml` and replace `es_host: localhost` by `es_host: docker.for.mac.localhost`. [Make sure to use Docker version 17.06 or up](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-macos). 

## Installation using npm and manual ElastAlert setup
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bitsensor/elastalert.git elastalert
    cd elastalert
    ```
2. Run `nvm install "$(cat .node-version)"` to install & use the required NodeJS version.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Look at the `Config` section to setup the path to your ElastAlert instance.

Now, you can run  the server with `npm start`. By default the server runs on http://localhost:3030.

## Building
If you want to build the server and run the build version:

1. Run the installation guide shown above
2. Run `npm run build`

You can then start the build by running `node lib/index.js`.

## Config
In `config/config.example.json` you'll find the default config. You can make a `config.json` file in the same folder that overrides the default config. When forking this repository it is recommended to remove `config.json` from the `.gitignore` file. For local testing purposes you can then use a `config.dev.json` file which overrides `config.json`.

You can use the following config options:

```javascript
{
  // The name of the app / server, used by the logging framework.
  "appName": "elastalert-server",
  
  // The port to bind to
  "port": 3030,
  
  // The path to the root ElastAlert folder. It's the folder that contains the `setup.py` script and the `config.yaml.example` file.
  "elastalertPath": "/opt/elastalert",
  
  // The path to the rules folder containing all the rules. If the folder is empty a dummy file will be created to allow ElastAlert to start.
  "rulesPath": {
  
    // Whether to use a path relative to the `elastalertPath` folder.
    "relative": true,
    
    // The path to the rules folder. 
    "path": "/rules"
  },
  
  // The path to a folder that the server can use to store data and temporary files.
  "dataPath": {
  
    // Whether to use a path relative to the `elastalertPath` folder.
    "relative": true,
    
    // The path to the data folder.
    "path": "/server_data"
  }
}
```
 
## API
This server exposes the following REST API's:

- **GET `/`**

    Exposes the current version running
  
- **GET `/status`**

    Returns either 'SETUP', 'READY', 'ERROR', 'STARTING', 'CLOSING', 'FIRST_RUN' or 'IDLE' depending on the current ElastAlert process status. 
  
- **GET `/status/control/:action`**

    Where `:action` can be either 'start' or 'stop', which will respectively start or stop the current ElastAlert process.
  
- **[WIP] GET `/status/errors`**

    When `/status` returns 'ERROR' this returns a list of errors that were triggered.
  
- **GET `/rules`**

    Returns a list of directories and rules that exist in the `rulesPath` (from the config) and are being run by the ElastAlert process.
  
- **GET `/rules/:id`**

    Where `:id` is the id of the rule returned by **GET `/rules`**, which will return the file contents of that rule.
  
- **POST `/rules/:id`**

    Where `:id` is the id of the rule returned by **GET `/rules`**, which will allow you to edit the rule. The body send should be:
  
      ```javascript
      {
        // Required - The full yaml rule config.
        "yaml": "..."
      }
      ```
    
- **DELETE `/rules/:id`**

    Where `:id` is the id of the rule returned by **GET `/rules`**, which will delete the given rule.
  
- **POST `/test`**

    This allows you to test a rule. The body send should be:
  
      ```javascript
      {
        // Required - The full yaml rule config.
        "rule": "...",
        
        // Optional - The options to use for testing the rule.
        "options": {
        
          // Can be either "all", "schemaOnly" or "countOnly". "all" will give the full console output. 
          // "schemaOnly" will only validate the yaml config. "countOnly" will only find the number of matching documents and list available fields.
          "testType": "all",
          
          // Can be any number larger than 0 and this tells ElastAlert over a period of how many days the test should be run
          "days": "1"
          
          // Whether to send real alerts
          "alert": false
        }
      }
      ``` 
    
- **[WIP] GET `/config`**

    Gets the ElastAlert configuration from `config.yaml` in `elastalertPath` (from the config).
  
- **[WIP] POST `/config`**

    Allows you to edit the ElastAlert configuration from `config.yaml` in `elastalertPath` (from the config). The required body to be send will be edited when the work on this API is done.
